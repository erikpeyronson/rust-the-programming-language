# The Rust Programming Language

A repository containing the code examples in the book "The Rust Programming Language" written down to practice while reading the book.

Each chapter is organized in a separate directory and subchapters are roughly organized in one or more crates where applicable. The directories prefixed with
"exercise-n" are my solutions to the suggested exercises.

Still a work in progress.
